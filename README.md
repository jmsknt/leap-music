# leap-music

The following repository contains the source code for my final year university project: Making Music with the Leap Motion Controller.

To run:

1. Ensure you have the Leap Motion software installed (I used the V2 SDK for Mac, so you may need the same).

2. Once you have set up the Leap Motion software, ensure the controller is plugged into you computer and is tracking.

3. Open the index.html file locally in a browser, ideally FIREFOX (the new Chome Web Audio API policies mean this project does not play sound correctly when running locally in Chrome).
